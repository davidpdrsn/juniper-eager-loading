//! juniper-eager-loading is a library for avoiding N+1 query bugs designed to work with
//! [Juniper][] and [juniper-from-schema][].
//!
//! It is designed to make the most common assocation setups easy to handle and while being
//! flexible and allowing you to customize things as needed. It is also 100% data store agnostic.
//! So regardless if your API is backed by an SQL database or another API you can still use this
//! library.
//!
//! If you're familiar with N+1 queries in GraphQL and eager loading, feel free to skip forward to
//! ["A real example"](#a-real-example).
//!
//! *NOTE*: Since this library requires [juniper-from-schema][] it is best if you're first familiar
//! with that.

//!
//! # What is N+1 query bugs?
//!
//! Imagine you have the following GraphQL schema
//!
//! ```graphql
//! schema {
//!     query: Query
//! }
//!
//! type Query {
//!     allUsers: [User!]!
//! }
//!
//! type User {
//!     id: Int!
//!     country: Country!
//! }
//!
//! type Country {
//!     id: Int!
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! And someone executes the following query:
//!
//! ```graphql
//! query SomeQuery {
//!     allUsers {
//!         country {
//!             id
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you resolve that query naively with an SQL database as you data store you will see something
//! like this in your logs:
//!
//! ```sql
//! select * from users
//! select * from countries where id = ?
//! select * from countries where id = ?
//! select * from countries where id = ?
//! select * from countries where id = ?
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! This happens because you first load all the users and then for each user in a loop you load
//! that user's country. That is 1 query to load the users and N additional queries to load the
//! countries. Therefore the name "N+1 query". These kinds of bugs can really hurt performance of
//! your app since you're doing many more database calls than necessary.
//!
//! One possible solution to this is called "eager loading". The idea is to load all countries up
//! front, before looping over the users. So instead of doing N+1 queries you do 2:
//!
//! ```sql
//! select * from users
//! select * from countries where id in (?, ?, ?, ?)
//! ```
//!
//! Since you're loading the countries up front, this strategy is called "eager loading".
//!
//! ## N+1s in GraphQL
//!
//! If you're not careful when implementing a GraphQL API you'll have lots of these N+1 query bugs.
//! Whenever a field returns a list of types and those types perform queries in their resolvers,
//! you'll have N+1 query bugs.
//!
//! This is also a problem in REST APIs, however because the responses are fixed we can more easily
//! setup the necessary eager loads because we know the types needed to compute the response.
//!
//! However in GraphQL the responses are not fixed. They depend on the incoming queries, which are
//! not known ahead of time. So setting up the correct amount of eager loading requires inspecting
//! the queries before executing them and eager loading the types requested such that the actual
//! resolvers wont need to run queries. That is exactly what this library does.
//!
//! # How this library works at a high level
//!
//! If you have a GraphQL type like this
//!
//! ```graphql
//! type User {
//!     id: Int!
//!     country: Country!
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You might create the corresponding Rust model type like this:
//!
//! ```
//! struct User {
//!     id: i32,
//!     country_id: i32
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! However this approach has one big issue. How are you going to resolve the field `User.country`
//! without doing a database query? All the resolver has access to is a `User` with a `country_id`
//! field. It can't get the country without loading it from the database...
//!
//! Fundamentally these kinds of model structs don't work for eager loading with GraphQL. So
//! this library takes a different approach.
//!
//! What if we created separate structs for the database models and the GraphQL models? Something
//! like this:
//!
//! ```
//! # fn main() {}
//! #
//! mod models {
//!     pub struct User {
//!         id: i32,
//!         country_id: i32
//!     }
//!
//!     pub struct Country {
//!         id: i32,
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! struct User {
//!     user: models::User,
//!     country: HasOne<Country>,
//! }
//!
//! struct Country {
//!     country: models::Country
//! }
//!
//! enum HasOne<T> {
//!     Loaded(T),
//!     NotLoaded,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now we're able to resolve the query with code like this:
//!
//! 1. Load all the users (first query).
//! 2. Map the users to a list of country ids.
//! 3. Load all the countries with those ids (second query).
//! 4. Pair up the users with the country with the correct id, so change `User.country` from
//!    `HasOne::NotLoaded` to `HasOne::Loaded(matching_country)`.
//! 5. When resolving the GraphQL field `User.country` simply return the loaded country.
//!
//! # A real example
//!
//! ```
//! use juniper::{Executor, FieldResult};
//! use juniper_eager_loading::{prelude::*, EagerLoading, HasOne};

//!     }
//!
//!     type User {
//!         id: Int!
//!         country: Country!
//!     }
//!
//!     type Country {
//!         id: Int!

//! }
//! #
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! # `#[derive(EagerLoading)]`
//!
//! For a type to support eager loading it needs to implement the following traits:
//!
//! - [`GraphqlNodeForModel`][]
//! - [`EagerLoadAllChildren`][]
//! - Each association field must implement [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`][]
//!
//! [`GraphqlNodeForModel`]: trait.GraphqlNodeForModel.html
//! [`EagerLoadAllChildren`]: trait.EagerLoadAllChildren.html
//!
//! Implementing these traits involves lots of boilerplate, therefore you should use
//! `#[derive(EagerLoading)]` to derive implementations as much as possible.
//!
//! Sometimes you might need customized eager loading for a specific association, in that case you
//! should still have `#[derive(EagerLoading)]` on your struct but implement
//! [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`][] yourself for the field that requires a custom setup. An example
//! of how to do that can be found
//! [here](trait.EagerLoadChildrenOfType.html#manual-implementation).
//!
//! [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`]: trait.EagerLoadChildrenOfType.html
//!
//! ## Attributes
//!
//! `#[derive(EagerLoading)]` has a few attributes you need to provide:
//!
//! | Name | Description | Default | Example |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `connection` | The type of connection your app uses. This could be a database connection or a connection to another web service. | N/A | `connection = "diesel::pg::PgConnection"` |
//! | `error` | The type of error eager loading might result in. | N/A | `error = "diesel::result::Error"` |
//! | `model` | The model type behind your GraphQL struct | `models::{name of struct}` | `model = "crate::db::models::User"` |
//! | `id` | Which id type does your app use? | `i32` | `id = "UUID"` |
//! | `root_model_field` | The name of the field has holds the backing model | `{name of struct}` in snakecase. | `root_model_field = "user"` |
//!
//! # Associations
//!
//! Assocations are things like "user has one country". These are the fields that need to be eager
//! loaded to avoid N+1s. Each assocation works for different kinds of foreign key setups and has
//! to be eager loaded differently. They should fit most kinds of associations you have in your
//! app. Click on each for more detail.
//!
//! The documation for each assocation assumes that you're using an SQL database, but it should be
//! straight forward to adapt to other kinds of data stores.
//!
//! - [`HasOne`](struct.HasOne.html)
//! - [`OptionHasOne`](struct.OptionHasOne.html)
//! - [`HasMany`](struct.HasMany.html)
//! - [`HasManyThrough`](struct.HasManyThrough.html)
//!
//! For each field of your GraphQL struct that is one of these four types the trait
//! [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`][] will be implemented by `#[derive(EagerLoading)]`.
//!
//! ## Attributes supported on all associations
//!
//! These are the attributes that are supported on all associations. None of these attributes take
//! arguments.
//!
//! ### `skip`
//!
//! Skip implementing [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`][] for the field. This is useful if you need to
//! provide a custom implementation.
//!
//! ### `print`
//!
//! This will cause the implementation of [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`][] for the field to be printed
//! while compiling. This is useful when combined with `skip`. It will print a good starting place
//! for you to customize.
//!
//! The resulting code wont be formatted. We recommend you do that with
//! [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt).
//!
//! # Eager loading interfaces or unions
//!
//! Eager loading interfaces or unions is possible but it will require calling `.downcast()` on the
//! `QueryTrail`. See the [juniper-from-schema docs for more
//! info](https://docs.rs/juniper-from-schema/0.4.0/juniper_from_schema/#downcasting-for-interface-and-union-querytrails)
//! fo more info.
//!
//! # Eager loading fields that take arguments
//!
//! Eager loading fields that take arguments throws a bit of a wrench into things. Since field
//! arguments can change what a GraphQL resolver method returns in arbitrary ways, you're required
//! to implement [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`][] manually for that particular field.
//!
//! In your implementation you have to set [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType::FieldArguments`][] to the
//! type of the arguments struct generated by juniper-from-schema. You can find more info
//! [here](https://docs.rs/juniper-from-schema/0.4.2/juniper_from_schema/#querytrails-for-fields-that-take-arguments).
//!
//! You also have to implement [`LoadFrom<T, ArgumentType>`][`LoadFrom`] for your model. You can find a complete
//! example
//! [here](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/juniper-eager-loading/blob/master/juniper-eager-loading/tests/fields_with_arguments.rs).
//!
//! If you see a type error like:
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0308]: mismatched types
//!    --> juniper-eager-loading/tests/fields_with_arguments.rs:254:56
//!     |
//!    254 | #[derive(Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Debug, Ord, PartialOrd, EagerLoading)]
//!     |                                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected (), found struct `query_trails::CountryUsersArgs`
//!     |
//!     = note: expected type `&()`
//!                found type `&query_trails::CountryUsersArgs<'_>`
//! ```
//!
//! It is because your field `Country.users` takes arguments and therefore require a manual
//! implementation of [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`][]. You can read more
//! [here](trait.EagerLoadChildrenOfType.html#manual-implementation)
//! about doing that. The code generation always sets [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType::FieldArguments`][]
//! to `()` so therefore you get this type error. The neat bit is that the compiler wont let you
//! forget to handle arguments.
//!
//! [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType`]: trait.EagerLoadChildrenOfType.html
//! [`EagerLoadChildrenOfType::FieldArguments`]: trait.EagerLoadChildrenOfType.html#associatedtype.FieldArguments
//! [`LoadFrom`]: trait.LoadFrom.html
//!
//! # Diesel helper
//!
//! Implementing [`LoadFrom`][] for lots of model types might involve lots of boilerplate. If
//! you're using Diesel it is recommend that you use one of [the macros to
//! generate](index.html#macros) implementations.
//!

//!
//! # When your GraphQL schema doesn't match your database schema
//!
//! This library supports eager loading most kinds of association setups, however it probably
//! doesn't support all that might exist in your app. It also works best when your database schema
//! closely matches your GraphQL schema.
//!
//! If you find yourself having to implement something that isn't directly supported remember that
//! you're still free to implement you resolver functions exactly as you want. So if doing queries
//! in a resolver is the only way to get the behaviour you need then so be it. Avoiding some N+1
//! queries is better than avoiding none.
//!
//! However if you have a setup that you think this library should support please don't hestitate
//! to [open an issue](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/juniper-eager-loading).

///     }

///
/// Imagine now we need to eager load the list of companies a given user works at. That means
/// [`LoadFrom`][] would return `Vec<models::Company>`. However that isn't enough information once
